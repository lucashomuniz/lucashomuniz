Sênior Data Analyst with a strong background in engineering, with 𝟰 𝘆𝗲𝗮𝗿𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 connecting business to data. My expertise lies in 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗴𝗿𝗮𝗺𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗴𝘂𝗮𝗴𝗲𝘀, 𝗮𝗱𝘃𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗱 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀 and 𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝘃𝗶𝘀𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀. This combination, in addition to my 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗺𝘂𝗻𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘀𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝘀, 𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 and 𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲 𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁, allows me to solve a wide range of challenges with total precision.
